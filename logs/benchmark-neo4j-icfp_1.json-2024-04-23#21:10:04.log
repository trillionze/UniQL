---------------------------Execute SQL Query:SELECT count(*) FROM inst-----------------
---------------------------Execute Target Query:The SQL query provided is a simple count of all records in a table named `inst`. To translate this into a Neo4j Cypher query, we need to match all nodes of a certain type and count them. Assuming that `inst` corresponds to a label in Neo4j, the translation would be:

```cypher
MATCH (i:Inst)
RETURN count(*) AS count;
```

This Cypher query matches all nodes labeled as `Inst` and returns the count of these nodes.-----------------

---------------------------Execute Target Query:The SQL query provided is a simple aggregation query that counts the total number of entries in the `papers` table. To translate this into a Neo4j Cypher query, we will assume there is a node labeled `Paper` for each entry in the `papers` table. Here is the corresponding Cypher query:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Paper)
RETURN COUNT(*) AS count
```

This Cypher query matches all nodes with the label `Paper` and returns the count of these nodes.-----------------

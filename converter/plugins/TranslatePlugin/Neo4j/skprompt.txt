Translate SQL Query to Neo4j Cypher Query with Matching Attribute Names.
Requirement:
1. For SQL aggregation functions, link the operation and field with an underscore. For instance, convert max(score) in SQL to max_score.

Example 1:
SQL: SELECT date FROM weather WHERE max_temperature_f  >  85
Neo4j: MATCH (w:Weather) WHERE w.max_temperature_f > 85 RETURN w.date as date

Example 2:
SQL: SELECT zip_code FROM weather GROUP BY zip_code HAVING avg(mean_visibility_miles)  <  10
Neo4j: MATCH (w:Weather) WITH w.zip_code AS zip_code, AVG(w.mean_visibility_miles) AS avgVisibility WHERE avgVisibility < 10 RETURN zip_code
